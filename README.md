## How the game works:
* Each player goes one at a time automatically. The game lasts 6 rounds by default (Without a draw.) rolling a 6 sided dice by default.
  * `gameSpeed` - Change how quickly the game moves on. *(Seconds)*
  * `gameRounds` - Change how many rounds you want to play in the game.
  * `sidedDice` - Change the greatest number on the dice.
* Each player within in their turn rolls the dice twice.
  * If the 2 dices add up and the number is even, the player gets 10 points added to their score.
  * If the 2 dices add up and the number is odd, the player gets 5 points taken away from their score unless their score is less then 5 there is no change to their score.
  * If the players dice end up both equal to eachother they roll another dice, those values from those 3 dices add up to their score
* At the end of the game, the player with the most points win.
  * If both players end up with equal amount of points they both roll the dice once and whoever the gets the highest number within that roll wins.
  * If both players again end up with equal amount of points in the re-roll, they both roll the dice again until one person gets the greater number and is appointed winner.
